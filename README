Twisted WebSockets protocol

- To test it, run python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8888 to serve interact.html
- run python protocol.py and open http://localhost:8888/interact.html
- type something in the text box


The inspiration for a websocket server (and the test html) came from Joe Armstrong.

Check interact.py to learn how to setup a basic operations class and pass it to the protocol factory.
